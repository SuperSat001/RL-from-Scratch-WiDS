    "## Modeling simple RL problems by making their MDPs in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "We will create the MDPs for some of the example problems from Grokking textbook. For the simple environments, we can just hardcode the MDPs into a dictionary by exhaustively encoding the whole state space and the transition function. We will also go through a more complicated example where the state space is too large to be manually coded and we need to implement the transition function based on some state parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later on, you will not need to implement the MDPs of common RL problems yourself, most of the work is already done by the OpenAI Gym library, which includes models for most of the famous RL envis.\n",
